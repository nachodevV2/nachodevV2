### My Experience

### About me
I am a student living in the brilliant country of England, amazing at skidding Lua scripts and developing my own games
While you are here, consider checking out some of my random repos!

### Stuff
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: nothing
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: anything
- âš¡ Fun fact: It would require close to 2,000,000 mosquito bites in order to lose two liters, a life-threatening amount of blood.
